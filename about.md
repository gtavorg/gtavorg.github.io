I have over 25 years of experience in the information technology area. 
Throughout my career, I have evolved and grown in various roles: 
 * Developer in C++/Java, where I created many Linux terminal applications that run on mobile devices, reducing operation to half of the time; then transitioned to
 * Project leader in many projects to the logistics and distribution area, connecting thermal printers, barcode scanners, and scales.
 * QA Specialist, I created from scratch and managed the quality assurance department. This experience allowed me to learn, apply, and teach various technologies, in manual, automated, and load testing, using JIRA, SCRUM, Selenium, Jmeter, Postman, etc. This was to obtain applications with a tendency to zero errors after their delivery."
